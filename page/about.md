## EXPLODED VIEW (MX / D / GB / SWE)

![Exploded View - Band]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/exploded-view-band-picture.jpg)

Exploded View is a collaborative project helmed by the UK-born, Berlin-based political-journalist-turned-musician Anika   (Invada Records / Stones Throw). After playing a string of 2014 solo   shows in Mexico with a backing lineup composed of local producers  Martin  Thulin, Hugo Quezada and Amon Melgarejo, Anika and her new  bandmates  discovered a chemistry that they simply had to capture on  tape.

During  their rehearsals in Mexico City, the four musicians discovered  a new  sound, several steps removed from the krautrock-isms of Anika’s   previous work. The straight to tape sessions that followed in the San   Rafael neighborhood, ventured somewhere new; a lighter place,  unguarded,  veering from any script.  Improvisation was the guiding  principle and  the source of the band’s inspiration. The studio itself  was outfitted so  that every sound produced in the room would be  recorded. A Tascam 388  8-track captured everything – fully live, fully  improvised, first-takes  only. Produced by Thulin and Quezada and  mastered by Josh Bonati in NYC,  the long player is due out in August  2016.


‘No More Parties In The Attic’  is a song that finds  power in its conflict; a demented collage of  noisy perplexing tones and  ominous drones backed with distorted  guitars, a devastating bass line  and fractured rhythms. While Anika’s  jarring vocal display may appear  softer than her previous works, the  song is laced with her unmistakable  icy & nonchalant vocals  delivered in ruinous calm.
